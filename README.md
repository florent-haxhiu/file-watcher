# File System Watcher

A small file system monitoring app which shows files that have been modified, created or deleted

## How to extend

- [x] Add a file content checksumming
- [ ] Impl file filtering (should be done via the patterns already, just need to impl)
- [ ] Add a REST API to query file changes (might be interesting)
- [ ] Impl a TUI for an interface
